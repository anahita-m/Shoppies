## Project Overview

This project is my submission for Shopify's 2021 Frontend Development Internship. As someone who has mostly worked in backend development, I was at first considering applying for the backend internshp but as a huge film buff (hahaha i said film instead of movies so you already know) I couldn't resist taking on the frontend challenge after reading the prompt. My experience in frontend is fairly limited outside of 1 or 2 small projects but I really enjoyed working on this challenge in React and it gave me an opportunity to learn something new which is always fun. In addition to learning a lot on the job during this challenge, all my work got wiped out around 4 am on Friday (2 days before submission) after I'd already spent close to a week on it so after a brief moment of considering not applying, I started from scratch again at 5 am Friday and armed with my one week of knowledge was able to get back up to speed by Saturday morning. This experience has really boosted my confidence in being able to learn quickly and I'm excited to continue learn and work in frontend after this.
